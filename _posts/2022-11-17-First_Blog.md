# A demo first blog for KMIT Students

  Today we had a CE class. We learned suffixes today whereas yesterday we learned prefixes. What I liked about prefixes was we could intutively tell meaning of many prefixes using our vocablary knowledge till now. In suffixes we  have to think differently. I try to find meaning of suffix by thinking about many words ending with suffix and finding what is common change between word with suffix and without suffix in all words I think. But still we have to remember meanings because the method doesn't always work.  
  
  We had ACT class in which we learned about about a concept called Jacobians but I still dont know why the concept was created. And we learned about Quantum mechanics in EP and BEEE we started electric circuits.
