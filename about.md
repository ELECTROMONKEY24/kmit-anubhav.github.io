# About

Anubhav is created with the intention of staying connected, informed and engaged. This class blog will act as the main hub connecting the efforts of the class while making it easier to share knowledge, experiences, ideas and opinions without the pressure of assessment. Anubhav will offer great potential for aggregating the best content from the class. It is far more than writing posts, it is a social activity that involves collaborating with others and reflecting on various issues.
